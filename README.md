Setup:
I went out of my way to not include react, nextjs or anything like that. 
However, typescript is nice to have for hammering the OOP aspects 
more into my brain and tailwind makes me hate CSS less

Starting the project:

Inside the todo-remastered folder, use
- 'npx @tailwindcss/cli -i ./styles/input.css -o ./styles/output.css --watch'
- 'tsc --watch'

Both of these will run in the background so either disown the terminals if you prefer that
or just keep them somewhere.
